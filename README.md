### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# I'm Brian

### Software engineer with a timeline as twisty as code in a spaghetti factory: bootcamp graduate, layoff detour, degree enthusiast, and unwavering code aficionado.

**Much like breathing, coding has become a salient part of my life**

**I have a strong desire to learn everything coding related, but I'm humbled by the amount I can learn and retain**

**and so I've decided to focus on mastering JavaScript, Python and Problem-solving**

```javascript
while (noSuccess) {
  tryAgain();

  if (dead) break;
}
```
